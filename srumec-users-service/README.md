# Šrumec - Users Service
A microservice focused on users.

Each user has a unique ID that is generated by `pgcrypto`, a *PostgreSQL* module.

## Endpoints
- `GET` - get a single user
- `GET ALL` - get all users
- `POST` - add a user
- `PUT` - edit details of a user
- `DELETE` - delete a user

## Data Structure
Each `User` has the following structure:
| Attribute | Data type | Description |
|:-------|:-----------------| :-----------------------------------------------------------|
| id     | `Option<Uuid>`   | 128-bit number used to identify the user                    |
| name   | `String`         | username (does not need to be unique)                       |
| email  | `String`         | unique email (used for registration and login)              |
| role   | `Option<String>` | role of the user (default: 'user')                          |
| banned | `Option<bool>`   | dictates whether the user is banned or not (default: false) |
